    <p>1. Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and
      roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC
      SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit.
      The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and
      Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.

      Lander payloads: Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the thermal conductivity and
      temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the landing site;
      Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from
      NASA is accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.</p>

    <p>2. Rover payloads: Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for
      deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.

      Press Release on Aug 05, 2023
      Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an objective
      of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander will have the
      capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical
      analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have scientific payloads
      to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main function of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle
      injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the
      Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of
      Lander Module. The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an
      Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.

    <p id="p3">3. The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are:

      To demonstrate Safe and Soft Landing on Lunar Surface
      To demonstrate Rover roving on the moon and
      To conduct in-situ scientific experiments.
      To achieve the mission objectives, several advanced technologies are present in Lander such as,

      Altimeters: Laser & RF based Altimeters
      Velocimeters: Laser Doppler Velocimeter & Lander Horizontal Velocity Camera
      Inertial Measurement: Laser Gyro based Inertial referencing and Accelerometer package
      Propulsion System: 800N Throttleable Liquid Engines, 58N attitude thrusters & Throttleable Engine Control
      Electronics
      Navigation, Guidance & Control (NGC): Powered Descent Trajectory design and associate software elements
      Hazard Detection and Avoidance: Lander Hazard Detection & Avoidance Camera and Processing Algorithm
      Landing Leg Mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>4.To demonstrate the above said advanced technologies in earth condition, several Lander special tests have been
      planned and carried out successfully viz.

      Integrated Cold Test - For the demonstration of Integrated Sensors & Navigation performance test using helicopter
      as test platform
      Integrated Hot test – For the demonstration of closed loop performance test with sensors, actuators and NGC using
      Tower crane as test platform
      Lander Leg mechanism performance test on a lunar simulant test bed simulating different touch down conditions.
